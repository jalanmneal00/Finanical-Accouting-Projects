# Finanical-Accouting-Projects
Analyzation and visualization of data. 
Comparison of two different companies in the same industry. (accounting included)
I utilize skills in Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word. 
I used formalus and different graph designs, while also demonstrating writting and accounting skills.
These were collaboratative projects where I worked with 2 different business students in the same course. I was the team leader and role assigner in both projects.
